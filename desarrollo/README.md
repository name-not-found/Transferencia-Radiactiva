Solving Radiative Transfer Equation
===================================

## Abstract

The transfer of energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation is one of the most interesting phenomena known to men. The fields of application are both diverse and useful. In this project we aim to solve the **radiative transfer equation** by means of numerical aproximation, modeling conditions similar to those of the **Sun**, the closest star, to mesure parameters like __temperature__ and __density__ at a given altitude on the solar atmosphere. 

## Introduction

As a beam of energy travels space, it encounters several conditions wich modify the radiance in several ways:

    - Absorption
    - Emission 
    - Scattering

Each one of these either increase (+) or decrease (-) the radiation.
