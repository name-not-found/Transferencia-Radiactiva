Solving Radiative Transfer Equation
===================================

## Abstract

The transfer of energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation is one of the most interesting phenomena known to men. The fields of application are both diverse and useful. In this project we aim to solve the **radiative transfer equation** by means of numerical aproximation, modeling conditions similar to those of the **Sun** the closest star, to mesure parameters like __temperature__ and __density__.
