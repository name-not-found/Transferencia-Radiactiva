Solving Radiative Transfer Equation to calculate clouds opacity and their width.
===================================

## Abstract

The transfer of energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation is one of the most interesting phenomena known to men. The fields of application are both diverse and useful. In this project we aim to solve the **radiative transfer equation to calculate clouds opacity** by means of numerical aproximation, modeling conditions similar to those of the **Sun**, the closest star, to mesure parameters like __temperature__ and __density__ at a given altitude on the solar atmosphere and then calculate their width.

## Introduction

As a beam of energy travels space, it encounters several conditions wich modify the radiance in several ways:

    1. Absorption
    2. Emission 
    3. Scattering

Each one of these either increase (+) or decrease (-) the radiation. 
### Clouds 
In meteorology, a cloud is an aerosol consisting of a visible mass of minute liquid droplets, frozen crystals, or other particles suspended in the atmosphere of a planetary body or similar space. Water or various other chemicals may compose the droplets and crystals. On Earth, clouds are formed as a result of saturation of the air when it is cooled to its dew point, or when it gains sufficient moisture (usually in the form of water vapor) from an adjacent source to raise the dew point to the ambient temperature.<br>
For this modeling we consider the components of a cloud, basically clouds are composed of water particles. Tiny particles of water are densely packed and sunlight cannot penetrate far into the cloud before it is reflected out, giving a cloud its characteristic white color, especially when viewed from the top. Cloud droplets tend to scatter light efficiently, so that the intensity of the solar radiation decreases with depth into the gases. As a result, the cloud base can vary from a very light to very-dark-grey depending on the cloud's thickness and how much light is being reflected or transmitted back to the observer. High thin tropospheric clouds reflect less light because of the comparatively low concentration of constituent ice crystals or supercooled water droplets which results in a slightly off-white appearance.
